# Background Music for Portfolio

## Instructions

1. Place your background music file in this directory
2. Name it "background-music.mp3" (or update the source in the HTML file)
3. Use royalty-free music to avoid copyright issues

## Recommended Music Types

For a cyberpunk portfolio, consider music with:
- Synthwave/retrowave vibes
- Electronic ambient sounds
- Low to medium tempo to not be distracting
- No vocals or minimal vocals

## Volume Considerations

The audio volume is set to 0.2 (20%) by default in script.js to ensure it's not too intrusive.
You can adjust this value in the setupAudioPlayer function if needed.

## Browser Autoplay Policies

Most modern browsers block autoplay of audio with sound unless there's user interaction.
The site is configured to start playing audio after the first user interaction (click, scroll, etc.).
Users can always toggle the music on/off using the button in the bottom left corner.
